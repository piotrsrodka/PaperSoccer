Simple game for two with simple computer opponent

Paper Soccer 

(c) by Piotr Śródka

This game was inspired by paper game i played through primary and high school. 
In highschool I even wrote similar game in Pascal, but unfortunately I lost the source code. 
New version was much easier to write in C#. 
I wanted to keep the look and feel close to what you get on paper and honestly 
I recommend playing on real paper with two different color pens. 

How to play?
It's a soccer! Just put the ball into opponent's goal :). Use the mouse. At the beginning the "ball" is in the middle of the field. 
The first Player can move, by left mouse button clicking, in any direction 1 square apart in all the standard 8 directions. 
The first Player is supposed to shoot at the top goal. The ball symbol just next to Player 1 or 2 texts indicates whose turn it is. 
After first move there is a Player 2 turn and again with the mouse click he can choose the next place to go. 
You can't go again over the drew line. You can bounce from places where either first or second Player were. 
You can also bounce from the walls. The game is won when: 

You put the ball past goal line, 
Your opponent will have no place to go 
Your opponent will shoot suicide goal 
Good luck! 

Field

The standard version I know uses 8 by 10 square field with goals 2 square wide. 
However, you can choose any sensible size of playing field. 
In this version there must be even number of squares in both directions and the limiting sizes are: 4 by 4 minimum and 24 by 30 maximum. 
To change the field size navigate to menu "Match" and click "New size" - dialog box will open. 
Set your desired size or get back to default and hit "Start". 
The game window always tries to adjust the width of the field which means that sometimes 
you won't be able to see whole field in vertical direction.
